Twitch is a highly popular modern day streaming platform many use to produce content and make money off donations. Many new streamers are looking to get involved and may not know the best ways to get started and develop a consistent stream community. In this project, we took it upon ourselves to examine a Twitch Dataset which we got courtesy of Snap Stanford. We hope to be able to detect Twitch communities among gamers and be able to predict if connections will be created or broken in the future. We also hope to be able to characterize these networks by statistics such as views per stream and average followers and subscribers, and also use statistical analysis to derive the main factors for community formation. In the end, we wish to see that new streamers can utilize our conclusions to help them develop their communities and build their platforms.


Dataset: [Twitch Gamers](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch_gamers.html)

Results:
Applied the Louvain algorithm on a 166,000 node Twitch data set to identify distinct community clusters
Mapped nodes to attributes and used statistical analysis to discover common characteristics within each community 
Leveraged machine learning algorithm to perform link prediction between super communities and reveal broader trends
Created visualizations, including graphs and charts, to illustrate community patterns and commonalities
